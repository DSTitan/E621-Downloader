A quick and easy way to bulk fetch and download [e926](https://e926.net) or [e621](https://e621.net) posts by tags.

The download can be found [here](https://github.com/DSTitan/Fluffy-Fetcher/releases). <br/><br/>

## Usage

To use the program, select the website, input tags, change limit, choose a download location, preview posts retrieved, remove unwanted ones, and download! It's a straightforward process! <br/><br/>

## Configure

Configuration is simple as heading to the settings tab and changing what needs to be changed. Static tags allows you to have tags you don't want to continuously enter, for example blacklisted tags or rating, status and order tags. Some blacklisted tags are already added by default.
