A quick and easy way to bulk fetch and download [e621](https://e621.net) posts by tags.

The download can be found [here](https://github.com/DSTitan/Fluffy-Fetcher-E621/releases). <br/><br/>

## Usage

To use the program, simply run it and input the tags you want to filter by, the maximum number of posts to search for, and the download location. It's a straightforward process! <br/><br/>

## Configure

To configure the program settings, edit the `config.json` file.

If you want to apply certain tags every time you search, add them to the `static_tags` field in the `config.json` file within double quotes. For example `"static_tags": "rating:safe"`.
